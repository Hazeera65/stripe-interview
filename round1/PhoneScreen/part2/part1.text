You are given a string (e.g., "YNNYYN") representing customer visits to a shop, where:

'Y' means a customer comes at that hour.
'N' means no customer comes at that hour.
You can close the shop at any hour (from 0 to n, where n is the length of the string). The penalty is calculated as:

For every hour the shop is open and no customer comes ('N'), penalty +1.
For every hour the shop is closed and a customer comes ('Y'), penalty +1.
Your goal:
Find the earliest hour to close the shop so that the penalty is minimized.

Example:
Input: "YYNY"

Closing at hour 0: Penalty = 3
Closing at hour 1: Penalty = 2
Closing at hour 2: Penalty = 1
Closing at hour 3: Penalty = 2
Closing at hour 4: Penalty = 1
Earliest minimum penalty is at hour 2.
