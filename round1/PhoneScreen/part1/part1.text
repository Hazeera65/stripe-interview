The problem simulates a store's operation over a series of hours, where each hour is represented by a character in a string ('Y' for a customer visit, 'N' for no visit). The store closes at a specified hour (cost). The goal is to compute a "penalty" based on two rules:

For every hour the store is open (from hour 0 up to, but not including, cost), if no customer comes ('N'), add 1 to the penalty.
For every hour after the store is closed (from cost to the end), if a customer comes ('Y'), add 1 to the penalty.
This penalty helps determine the best closing time to minimize unnecessary open hours (when no customers come) and avoid missing customers after closing.

How the code works:

It iterates through each hour in the log.
For hours before closing, it checks for 'N' and increments the penalty.
For hours after closing, it checks for 'Y' and increments the penalty.
If the input is invalid (log too short or cost == -1), it returns -1.
This approach helps analyze store efficiency and customer service based on visit patterns.
