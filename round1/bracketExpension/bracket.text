roblem
You are given a string s representing a list of words. Each letter in the word has one or more options.

If there is one option, the letter is represented as is.
If there is more than one option, then curly braces delimit the options. For example, "{a,b,c}" represents options ["a", "b", "c"].
For example, if s = "a{b,c}", the first character is always 'a', but the second character can be 'b' or 'c'. The original list is ["ab", "ac"].

Return all words that can be formed in this manner, sorted in lexicographical order.

Examples
Example 1:

Input: s = "{a,b}c{d,e}f"
Output: ["acdf","acef","bcdf","bcef"]

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd"
Output: ["abcd"]

Solution
Method 1 - Backtracking
The problem aims to generate all possible combination strings. Upon encountering a {, combinations are formed using the given options, then the process continues from the character following }. For regular letters, the next character in the string is processed directly. Finally, the resulting combinations are sorted in ascending lexicographical order.

This problem is close to [Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number)

Here is the approach:

Parse the given string s using a loop:
If a character is not enclosed in {}, treat it as a single option (e.g., 'a' becomes ['a']).
If a character is enclosed in {}, extract all options (e.g., "{b,c}" becomes ['b', 'c']).
Use backtracking to generate all possible combinations of words:
Start at the first position and choose an option for each component.
Recursively combine options from subsequent components.
After generating all possible combinations, sort the resultant list of words lexicographically.
